# GOanalysisWorkflow
This is an initial draft for the analysis workflow for the data from the differential expression analysis. It will create independant directories for each analysis type (OR, GO, GSEA, EnrichR based analysis), and when the analysis has completed, it will ask for the deletion of variables created during the analysis.
