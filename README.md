# GOanalysisWorkflow
Gene ontology is a fundamental analysis in systems biology to understand the overall direction of the celular system. It involves various statistical methods to evaluate which pathway is enriched (over-represented) in the given biological system.
This is an initial draft of the analysis workflow for the data from the differential gene expression analysis experiments, but it can be used for differential abundance for proteomics as well. It will create independant directories for each analysis type (overrepresentation analysis (OR), gene ontology analysis (GOA), GSEA, EnrichR based analysis), signaling pathway impact analysis (SPIA). Once, the analysis has been completed, it will ask for the deletion of variables created during the analysis to clean the environemtn for the next analysis.
Most of the commands have been gathered from the user manuals of the libraries used here, various tutorials written by different people and StackOverflow and then modified to suit the analysis needs.
